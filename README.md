# Raspberry Pi - WPA2 Access Point
On first boot, you can wget the "rpi-ap.sh".

To run the script, run the following

sudo bash rpi-ap.sh

The script will get the latest updates and apply all necessary configs for your Pi to act as an access point.
You need to specify "wlan0" as your wireless card if you're not using a secondary external wireless card.
